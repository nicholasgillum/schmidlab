  main: > 
    The following code draws a plot of the raw data for each microarray. 
    Specifically, it draws an MA plot of the regulation values (M values, 
    differential expression) of all the genes against their average 
    expression (A). The red and green lines in the plot represent the 
    mean and median, respectively. The turquoise line in the plot 
    represents the lowess fit line.
  verbose: >
    The following MA plots show the data after background correction.
  quiet: >
    These diagnostic plots have been suppressed. Please edit the 
    config.yaml file and set quiet:backgroundCorrection to no to 
    re-enable them.
